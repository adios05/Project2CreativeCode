      <h2> Fashion is a powerful form of self-expression, allowing us to communicate who we are without words. The original drawings that inspired this project really drew me with their free-flowing brushstrokes and vibrant colors. The emotion in the art directly influenced the designs, creating outfits that felt like wearable expressions of identity. Fashion, like art, is an outlet for personal creativityâ€”something we often overlook. These illustrations reminded me how clothing can be a canvas, offering a unique way to express ourselves in a manner that pushes art and creates a sense of self. </h2>
